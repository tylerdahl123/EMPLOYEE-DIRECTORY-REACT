# EMPLOYEE-REACT-DIRECTORY
## Description
 ---
 
 For this project I used react to build out a simple employee directory. It allows the user to be able to search and also filter by alphabetical order. The search function is not as streamlined as I would like and I plan on going back and fleshing out that feature more.
## Install 
---

 Simply clone the repo onto your local machine and run an npm i and you should be good to go. Well, make sure you can run npm in your command line
